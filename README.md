# NCoding Challenge

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependecies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, create the file `.env.local` at the root of this project and add the following:

```env
API_HOST=http://localhost:3000/api
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
